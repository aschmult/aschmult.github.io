                <p>I am currently a student at the Villanova School of Business, where I will graduate in 2022. Although I have yet to delare a major, I am particularly interested in finance, data analytics, and accounting. In addition, I am considering a second major or a minor in math, statistics, or computer science.</p>
                <p>I hope to be able to combine my passion for business with my love for math and computer science, such as working in applied data science or quantitative finance.</p>
                <p>Outside of classes, I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey and spending time with my team, as well as attending the events campus life has to offer. I dedicate a lot of my free time to Tech Crew, both as a job and a hobby.</p>

                <h4>Princeton, NJ</h4>
                <p>I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I enjoyed calculus and statistics.</p>
                <p>While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility.</p>

                <h3>Villanova University Tech Crew</h3>
                <p>Tech Crew is Villanova's student run event production business. We provide audio, lighting, and video support for events around campus, from guest speakers to large-scale concerts. In 2018, we had reveune of over $60,000, and worked 153 events.</p>
                <p>I joined Tech Crew about a month after starting school at Villanova. During my first semester, I worked as an Event Staff and a Senior Staff member, and I took my Head Technician test in December. As a Head Technician, my responsibilities are to be responsibile for client events. This includes managing a group of 3-8 staff, coordinating with clients, and troubleshooting technical issues. </p>
                <p>At the start of 2019, I joined the Executive Board of Tech Crew as the Events Manager. As Events Manager, I take client specifications for events, and develop a plan for equipment and staffing. For large scale events, I attend production meetings and coordinate equipment rentals. Additionally, as problems with staffing or equipment arise, I work with other Executive Board members to find solutions.</p>

                <h3>BetterTrader</h3>
                <p>During the summer of 2019, I worked at BetterTrader as a Research and Marketing Intern. When I started at BetterTrader, I noticed that blog content and articles needed improving on, both content-wise and gramatically. Additionally, social media was being underutilized.</p>
                <p>At BetterTrader, I started three projects. First, I began a process of editing grammar and content of each blog post and article. Next, I edited each blog post and article to improve search engine optimization, by refining URLs, snippets, and SEO titles. Finally, I started posting short blog summaries three time a week on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>
                <p>BetterTrader is located in the High Tech Village on the campus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. I spent June and July in Israel, on an organized internship program. The opportunity to work and live outside of the US and learn how business is contucted internationally was invaluable to me.</p>
