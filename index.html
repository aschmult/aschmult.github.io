                    <p>While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility.</p>

                    <h3>Villanova University Tech Crew</h3>
                    <p>Tech Crew is Villanova's student run event production business. We provide audio, lighting, and video support for events around campus, from guest speakers to large-scale concerts. In 2019, we had revenue of over $85,000, and worked 207 events.</p>
                    <p>I joined Tech Crew about a month after starting school at Villanova. During my first semester, I worked as an Event Staff and a Senior Staff member, and I took my Head Technician test in December. As a Head Technician, I am responsible for running client events. This includes managing a group of 3-8 staff, coordinating with clients, and troubleshooting technical issues. </p>
                    <p>At the start of 2020, I became the Vice President of Tech Crew. As Vice President, I am responsible for coordinating the logistics of large-scale events, including managing equipment rentals, attending production meetings, and creating staffing plans. I also help oversee the Events Managers, and assist them with questions or issue about small-scale events. Additionally, as a member of the Executive Board, I participate in making decisions about the future of the organization, and step in to help other members when they cannot fulfil their duties.</p>

                    <p>During the summer of 2019, I worked at BetterTrader as a Research and Marketing Intern. When I started at BetterTrader, I noticed that blog content and articles needed improving on, both content-wise and grammatically. Additionally, social media was being underutilized.</p>
                    <p>At BetterTrader, I started three projects. First, I began a process of editing grammar and content of each blog post and article. Next, I edited each blog post and article to improve search engine optimization, by refining URLs, snippets, and SEO titles. Finally, I started posting short blog summaries three time a week on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>

                    <h3>Ice Hockey</h3>
                    <p>I started playing ice hockey during my sophomore year of high school, in what would be classified as an impulsive decision. Although I do not generally advocate for impulsive decisions, this was a good one. In high school, my practices required waking up at 4:30am, which forced me to improve my time management and discipline.</p>
                    <p>When I have free time, I enjoy watching NHL hockey. I support the Detroit Red Wings, along with other Detroit sports teams, and some of my favorite players are Dylan Larkin and Niklas Kronwall, who has recently retired from play. I also enjoy attending games, including other local college teams.</p>

I enjoy reading about and looking at various sound and lighting setups, both online and while out. It is always interesting to enter a venue, and immediately start looking at the PA system.</p>

                <h3>My Professional Identity</h3>
                <p>This project was created for my Backpack to Briefcase professional development seminar during the middle of my first semester sophomore year. It provides a snapshot of the ideas and ambitions I had at the time, and I have chosen not to update it since.</p>

            <div class = "project">
                <h3>My Website</h3>
                <p>This website was created as a personal project during the summer of 2019, while I was abroad interning at Better Trader. The website is written entirely from scratch, with help from w3schools and StackOverflow, and a lot of time working with a hex color picker and a css gradient maker. It is hosted through GitHub, and you can <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://github.com/aschmult/aschmult.github.io">view the repository</a></span>, which includes the current website, old versions, and some files that are me just playing around.</p>
                <p>The current site is the fourth version I have created. The <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version1"> original version</a></span> of the site was fairly primitive and not written with best practices in mind, and was not at all mobile responsive. The <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version2">second version</a></span> was mobile responsive, but was boring to look at. The <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version3">third version</a></span> was created to be somewhat similar to the current site, with a background and white cards, but was never quite finished. I intended to add functionality to have one card displayed on the first slide, but never got around to writing the JavaScript. In addition, using an image as the background slowed down the loading of the site.</p>
                <p>I created the current version of the site shortly after beginning to work on the Professional Identity project mentioned above. The original design for that project was plain white with grey lines dividing sections, but I decided to do something with some color, and I got the idea to do a gradient background with white cards, and I liked the style enough that I decided to re-do my website in the same style.</p>

                <h3>Competitive Effectiveness</h3>
                <p>The Villanova School of Business considers hands-on and experiential learning to be invaluable in preparing students for working in the real world. One course that follows the model of experiential learning is Competitive Effectiveness, a 6-credit course combining the principles of management and marketing. Students, in groups of ten, work on marketing projects for clients by applying the concepts learned in class.</p>
                <p>The project I am currently working on is for AirWick, a brand of Reckitt Benckiser, which includes various air care products. The objective of the project is to increase the market share of AirWick in the liquid electricals category of the air care market. My role within the project is the Marketing Director, meaning I am responsible for ensuring the accuracy of marketing concepts as they are represented within the project, and that my group applies those same concepts to our work together.</p>

                <h3>VUTC Website and Database Development</h3>
                <p>Around April of 2019, when I was working as the VUTC Events Manager, I got frustrated that there was no single place where I could see all the different pieces of information that I needed to know about each event. I asked members of the VUTC Webteam to consider creating a page for me to display all this information in a summary form, and they suggested I should learn to create webpages myself. I decided to take it on as a project, and in October, the project was finished. The result is the Events Dashboard, which displays all the current event requests and ongoing events, along with nine key pieces of information about each. While working on this dashboard, I learned how to write SQL queries, format pages using CSS, and how to maintain page formatting on mobile devices.</p>
                <p>In December of 2019, as I was getting ready to prepare the next Events Manager for the role, I realized that there was no formal process for passing information about a client organization from one year's Executive Board to the next year's. In addition, we were unable to effectively sort events by client organization. The solution I came up with was to create a system of client profiles. Each event would be linked to a profile, and Events Managers could leave comments on a client profile to convey information about the client for those to come.</p>
                <p>While I was working on the system of client profiles, I had the idea to add the ability to leave feedback about VUTC, either as a client giving feedback on an event they hired us for, or a member giving feedback on their experience working for us. While working on this project, I had the opportunity to learn about regular expressions, as a way of validating an email address. While doing some final review of the code, I realized that I was not adequately protecting against SQL injection. After properly addressing the issue on the new pages I had created, I found several old pages which were vulnerable to SQL injection as well, which I also updated.</p>
