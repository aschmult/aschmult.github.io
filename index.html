                    <h4>Villanova, PA</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a student at the Villanova, where I will graduate in May 2022. I am majoring in 
                        Management Information Systems, and minoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. 
                        My MIS major and AI & ML minor are offered through Villanova School of Business, and my CS minor is through 
                        Villanova's Department of Computing Science.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Villanova, I've tried to take advatage of the wide variety of courses offered. Carrying in 29 credits from AP 
                        exams helped me to get a head start on core curriculum requirements, and I've been able to take advantage of that 
                        to take a variety of courses which interest me, but aren't required for my major or minors. Most of the extra 
                        courses I've taken have been technical in nature, such as Digitial Forensics, Cybersecurity, and Data Mining. Some 
                        of my technically-minded coursework includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Algorithms & Data Structures I & II</li>
                        <li>Database Management</li>
                        <li>Computing Systems</li>
                        <li>Mobile App Developmet</li>
                        <li>Systems Analysis & Design</li>
                        <li>Discrete Structures</li>
                        <li>Analysis of Algorithms</li>
                        <li>AI & Machine Learning for Business</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I've worked to strive for academic excelence, earning a 3.96 technical GPA and a 3.81 overall GPA, and making the Dean's 
                        List every semeter. Projects I've worked on for my courses can be found under my 
                        <a><span onclick = "currentSlide(4)">'Projects'</span></a> section. However, I've also tried to keep a focus on learning 
                        outside of the classroom, particularly in my involvement with VUTC, which you can read more about under my 
                        <span onclick = "currentSlide(3)">'Experience'</span> section.

                    <h4>Princeton, NJ</h4>
                    <p>
                        I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, 
                        especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I enjoyed calculus and 
                        statistics. I took eight AP courses in a range of subjects, and earned the National AP Scholar and AP Scholar 
                        with distinction awards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. 
                        I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both 
                        organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the 
                        PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility, particularly because our 
                        practices were at 5:30am.

                    <p>
                        Tech Crew is Villanova's student run event production business. We provide audio, lighting, and video support 
                        for events around campus, from guest speakers to large-scale concerts. In 2019, we had revenue of over $85,000, 
                        and worked 207 events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I joined Tech Crew about a month after starting school at Villanova. During my first semester, I worked as 
                        an Event Staff and a Senior Staff member, and I took my Head Technician test in December. As a Head Technician, 
                        I am responsible for running client events. This includes managing a group of 3-8 staff, coordinating with 
                        clients, and troubleshooting technical issues. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of 2020, I became the President of Tech Crew. As President, I am responsible for 
                        coordinating the logistics of large-scale events, including managing equipment rentals, attending production 
                        meetings, and creating staffing plans. I also oversee the Events Managers, and assist them with 
                        questions or issues about small-scale events. Additionally, as a member of the Executive Board, I participate 
                        in making decisions about the future of the organization, and step in to help other members when they cannot 
                        fulfill their duties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with my other roles within VUTC, I am also a member of the Web Team. As a Web Team member, I work to 
                        keep the VUTC website, <a href="https://www.vutc.com" target="_blank">vutc.com</a>, up-to-date. I have found 
                        and fixed bugs and security issues, and added new functionality, including a system for clients and staff 
                        members to submit feedback. In addition, I am currently working with Web Team to re-write the website from the 
                        ground up, including a new database. I designed the ERD for the new database, and created it using Laravel.

                        events platform with a low-code website builder, and WordPress, an industry standard content management 
                        system. The work I did involved drag-and-drop website creation, along with writing custom CSS and JavaScript elements 
                        to meet client specifications. In addition to my work with Bizzabo and WordPress, I set up various subdomains 
                        so that each virtual event produced by ASP could have a custom subdomain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my development work, I also worked alongside production specialists to ensure customer satisfaction 
                        during virtual and hybrid events. In this role, I interacted directly with clients and event attendees to troubleshoot 
                        technical issues experienced during the course of events attended by over one thousand people.

                    <p>
                        During the summer of 2019, I worked at BetterTrader as a Research and Marketing Intern. When I started at 
                        BetterTrader, I noticed that blog content and articles needed improving on, both content-wise and 
                        grammatically. Additionally, social media was being underutilized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At BetterTrader, I started three projects. First, I began a process of editing grammar and content of 
                        each blog post and article. Next, I edited each blog post and article to improve search engine optimization, 
                        by refining URLs, snippets, and SEO titles. Finally, I started posting short blog summaries three time a 
                        week on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>
                Between assignments for my classes and personal projects I choose to work on in my free time, I have worked on several 
                things I am proud to have created. Here are a few:
            </p>
    
            <h3>VUTC Website and Database Development</h3>
            <p>
                VUTC is an organization I am a part of, which works doing event production for other campus organizations at Villanova. 
                In order to facilitate all our operations, we have a website, which the VUTC Web Team writes, updates, and maintains. 
                The website allows clients to input event requests, facilitates planning of event details, allows staff to sign up
                for events, and coordinates timesheets and pay. However, the I would describe the website as "funky", particularly
                in that it was written without regard for best practices in coding. As such, we have decided to do a full-stack 
                re-design of the website. We will be designing and building a new database, populating it with previous data, 
                re-writing all the code for the website (including giving it a new look), and adding some new features. The new website 
                will be written using the Laravel PHP framework, and a MySQL database. For the front end, we are using the Bootstrap 
                templates Paper Kits and AdminLTE.
            </p>
            <p>
                As of Fall 2020, the new website is estimated to be about a third of the way done. I started by working to design the 
                new database, which included making an ERD. The database currently has 33 tables, but more may be added as new 
                functionality is added. Next, I wrote migrations to create the database which had been designed, and then wrote 
                models corresponding to the various tables. As of the fall, the project has been split between various Web Team members.
                Each member takes a section of the website, and works to write the controllers and views necessary for that section. I 
                have been working on the events section, and have finished the functionality for clients to request events, for staff 
                to view said events, and for most edits to event information to be made. I am currently working on the functionality to 
                generate quotes for events. I have currently written about 4,500 lines of code for the project.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to my work on the new website, I have also worked on the existing legacy site, which can be found at 
                <a href="https://www.vutc.com" target="_blank">vutc.com</a>. My projects have included creating an Events Dashboard, 
                which displays 12 key pieces of information about each event, allowing for easier management of multiple events at once.
                In addition, I created a system of client profiles to allow events management staff to better keep track of the needs 
                of various clients, and a system to collect feedback from both clients and staff members. I have also made various 
                other minor updates, including checking and updating protection against SQL injection on various forms.

                    <h3>Tikvah Email Migration</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the fall of 2021, I took the course Systems Analysis and Design, which focused on analyzing and creating information 
                        systems for businesses. The culmination of the course was a project in which groups of students worked to assist local 
                        charitable organizations to update their existing information systems. I worked with a Philly-based group called Tikvah, 
                        which advocates for and provides services to Jewish adults with mental illness. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work I did for Tikvah involved migrating their email platform from Ionos to Google Workspace. This involved activating 
                        Google Workspace, creating user accounts and adding basic information, creating DNS records, and training Tikvah staff 
                        in the use of their Google Workspace accounts, both for day-to-day use and basic administration functions. I also 
                        collaborated with Tikvah's external web developer, who worked with DNS record creation and worked to move existing emails 
                        from Ionos to Gmail.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While I worked on the email migration portion of the project, my groupmates worked on various other improvements to 
                        Tikvah's information systems, including creating a Salesforce domain for them and cleaning and importing data to 
                        Salesforce. In addition, we all worked to research and implement a solution to integrate Gmail and otjer Google 
                        Workspace apps into Salesforce.

            <h3>Used Textbook Sales App</h3>
            <p>
                In the spring of 2021, I took Mobile App Development, where I learned the basics of writing apps using React Native, which 
                involved making various apps, which were tested using Expo. The apps I made included a weather app and an app which gave you a 
                fact about the building on campus you were closest to. The culminating project for the class was a group project in which you 
                created an app, and my group chose to make an app to facilitate the swapping of used textbooks. The app used a Facebook 
                marketplace type model, where it served to connect intersted, buyers and sellers, but leaving price negotiation, payment, 
                and actually handing the book over to the users.
            </p>
            <p>
                I took the lead within my group, first by teaching them to use GitHub as a way to share code- the recommended method was to 
                email files to each other. I contributed around 2,500 lines of code, which handled the core functions of creating an account, 
                updating account information, and chatting with other users.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app would best be described as a prototype- we chose to focus on demonstrating basic functionality and considering systems 
                which would be most helpful to users, over front-end graphics.

                    <h3>My Website</h3>
                    <p>
                        This website was originally created as a personal project during the summer of 2019, while I was abroad interning at Better 
                        Trader. The website is written entirely from scratch, with help from w3schools and StackOverflow, and a lot of 
                        time working with a hex color picker and a css gradient maker. It is hosted through GitHub, and you can 
                        <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://github.com/aschmult/aschmult.github.io">view 
                        the repository</a></span>, which includes the current website, old versions, and some files that are me just playing 
                        around.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The current site is the fourth version I have created. The 
                        <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version1"> original version
                        </a></span> of the site was fairly primitive and not written with best practices in mind, and was not at all mobile 
                        responsive. The <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version2">second 
                        version</a></span> was mobile responsive, but was boring to look at. The 
                        <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version3">third version</a></span> 
                        was created to be somewhat similar to the current site, with a background and white cards, but was never quite finished. 
                        I intended to add functionality to have one card displayed on the first slide, but never got around to writing the 
                        JavaScript. In addition, using an image as the background slowed down the loading of the site. Please note that none of 
                        the old versions of the website have been kept up to date with recent information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I created the current version of the site shortly after beginning to work on the Professional Identity project mentioned 
                        below. The original design for that project was plain white with grey lines dividing sections, but I decided to do 
                        something with some color, and I got the idea to do a gradient background with white cards, and I liked the style enough 
                        that I decided to re-do the rest of my website in the same style.

                This project was created for my Backpack to Briefcase professional development seminar during the middle of my 
                first semester sophomore year. It provides a snapshot of the ideas and ambitions I had at the time, and I have 
                chosen not to update it since.

                    <p>
                        I started playing ice hockey during my sophomore year of high school, in what would be classified as an 
                        impulsive decision. Although I do not generally advocate for impulsive decisions, this was a good one. 
                        In high school, my practices required waking up at 4:30am, which forced me to improve my time management 
                        and discipline.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I played hockey through high school, and my freshman and sophomore years at Villanova, when a variety 
                        of factors lead to me having to give hockey up. However, I really enjoyed the time that I got to spend 
                        playing hockey, and I continue to skate as much as I can.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I have free time, I enjoy watching NHL hockey. I support the Detroit Red Wings, along with other 
                        Detroit sports teams, and some of my favorite players are Dylan Larkin and Niklas Kronwall, who has recently 
                        retired from play. I also enjoy attending games, including other local college teams.
