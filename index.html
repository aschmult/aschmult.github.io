                    <h4>Villanova, PA</h4>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a student at the Villanova, where I will graduate in May 2022. I am majoring in 
                        Management Information Systems, and minoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. 
                        My MIS major and AI & ML minor are offered through Villanova School of Business, and my CS minor is through 
                        Villanova's Department of Computing Science.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Villanova, I've tried to take advatage of the wide variety of courses offered. Carrying in 29 credits from AP 
                        exams helped me to get a head start on core curriculum requirements, and I've been able to take advantage of that 
                        to take a variety of courses which interest me, but aren't required for my major or minors. Most of the extra 
                        courses I've taken have been technical in nature, such as Digitial Forensics, Cybersecurity, and Data Mining. Some 
                        of my technically-minded coursework includes:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Algorithms & Data Structures I & II</li>
                        <li>Database Management</li>
                        <li>Computing Systems</li>
                        <li>Mobile App Developmet</li>
                        <li>Systems Analysis & Design</li>
                        <li>Discrete Structures</li>
                        <li>Analysis of Algorithms</li>
                        <li>AI & Machine Learning for Business</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        I've worked to strive for academic excelence, earning a 3.96 technical GPA and a 3.81 overall GPA, and making the Dean's 
                        List every semeter. However, I've also tried to keep a focus on learning outside of the classroom, particularly 
                        in my involvement with VUTC, which you can read more about under my 'Experience' section.

                    <p>
                        I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, 
                        especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I enjoyed calculus and 
                        statistics. I took eight AP courses in a range of subjects, and earned the National AP Scholar and AP Scholar 
                        with distinction awards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. 
                        I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both 
                        organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the 
                        PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility, particularly because our 
                        practices were at 5:30am.

                    <p>
                        Tech Crew is Villanova's student run event production business. We provide audio, lighting, and video support 
                        for events around campus, from guest speakers to large-scale concerts. In 2019, we had revenue of over $85,000, 
                        and worked 207 events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I joined Tech Crew about a month after starting school at Villanova. During my first semester, I worked as 
                        an Event Staff and a Senior Staff member, and I took my Head Technician test in December. As a Head Technician, 
                        I am responsible for running client events. This includes managing a group of 3-8 staff, coordinating with 
                        clients, and troubleshooting technical issues. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the start of 2020, I became the President of Tech Crew. As President, I am responsible for 
                        coordinating the logistics of large-scale events, including managing equipment rentals, attending production 
                        meetings, and creating staffing plans. I also oversee the Events Managers, and assist them with 
                        questions or issues about small-scale events. Additionally, as a member of the Executive Board, I participate 
                        in making decisions about the future of the organization, and step in to help other members when they cannot 
                        fulfill their duties.

                    <p>
                        Along with my other roles within VUTC, I am also a member of the Web Team. As a Web Team member, I work to 
                        keep the VUTC website, <a href="https://www.vutc.com" target="_blank">vutc.com</a>, up-to-date. I have found 
                        and fixed bugs and security issues, and added new functionality, including a system for clients and staff 
                        members to submit feedback. In addition, I am currently working with Web Team to re-write the website from the 
                        ground up, including a new database. I designed the ERD for the new database, and created it using Laravel.

                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2020, I worked at Advanced Staging Productions as a Virtual Events Intern. ASP does professional 
                        event production work, including on campus alongside VUTC, which is how I was introduced to the company. My work 
                        with ASP involved working on various aspects of virtual event production, including setting up websites and 
                        advising Project Managers on the most effective use of web tools. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, I worked with Bizzabo, a virtual 
                        events platform with a low-code website builder, and WordPress, an industry standard content management 
                        system. The work I did involved drag-and-drop website creation, along with writing custom CSS and JavaScript elements 
                        to meet client specifications. In addition to my work with Bizzabo and WordPress, I set up various subdomains 
                        so that each virtual event produced by ASP could have a custom subdomain.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my development work, I also worked alongside production specialists to ensure customer satisfaction 
                        during virtual and hybrid events. In this role, I interacted directly with clients and event attendees to troubleshoot 
                        technical issues experienced during the course of events attended by over one thousand people.

                        During the summer of 2019, I worked at BetterTrader as a Research and Marketing Intern. When I started at 
                        BetterTrader, I noticed that blog content and articles needed improving on, both content-wise and 
                        grammatically. Additionally, social media was being underutilized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At BetterTrader, I started three projects. First, I began a process of editing grammar and content of 
                        each blog post and article. Next, I edited each blog post and article to improve search engine optimization, 
                        by refining URLs, snippets, and SEO titles. Finally, I started posting short blog summaries three time a 
                        week on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.

                    The current site is the fourth version I have created. The 
                    <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version1"> original version
                    </a></span> of the site was fairly primitive and not written with best practices in mind, and was not at all mobile 
                    responsive. The <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version2">second 
                    version</a></span> was mobile responsive, but was boring to look at. The 
                    <span><a style = "color: black;" target="_blank" href = "https://aschmult.github.io/version3">third version</a></span> 
                    was created to be somewhat similar to the current site, with a background and white cards, but was never quite finished. 
                    I intended to add functionality to have one card displayed on the first slide, but never got around to writing the 
                    JavaScript. In addition, using an image as the background slowed down the loading of the site. Please note that none of 
                    the old versions of the website have been kept up to date with recent information.

                    I created the current version of the site shortly after beginning to work on the Professional Identity project mentioned 
                    below. The original design for that project was plain white with grey lines dividing sections, but I decided to do 
                    something with some color, and I got the idea to do a gradient background with white cards, and I liked the style enough 
                    that I decided to re-do the rest of my website in the same style.

                <h3>VUTC Website and Database Development</h3>
                <p>
                    VUTC is an organization I am a part of, which works doing event production for other campus organizations at Villanova. 
                    In order to facilitate all our operations, we have a website, which the VUTC Web Team writes, updates, and maintains. 
                    The website allows clients to input event requests, facilitates planning of event details, allows staff to sign up
                    for events, and coordinates timesheets and pay. However, the I would describe the website as "funky", particularly
                    in that it was written without regard for best practices in coding. As such, we have decided to do a full-stack 
                    re-design of the website. We will be designing and building a new database, populating it with previous data, 
                    re-writing all the code for the website (including giving it a new look), and adding some new features. The new website 
                    will be written using the Laravel PHP framework, and a MySQL database. For the front end, we are using the Bootstrap 
                    templates Paper Kits and AdminLTE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As of Fall 2020, the new website is estimated to be about a third of the way done. I started by working to design the 
                    new database, which included making an ERD. The database currently has 33 tables, but more may be added as new 
                    functionality is added. Next, I wrote migrations to create the database which had been designed, and then wrote 
                    models corresponding to the various tables. As of the fall, the project has been split between various Web Team members.
                    Each member takes a section of the website, and works to write the controllers and views necessary for that section. I 
                    have been working on the events section, and have finished the functionality for clients to request events, for staff 
                    to view said events, and for most edits to event information to be made. I am currently working on the functionality to 
                    generate quotes for events. I have currently written about 4,500 lines of code for the project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to my work on the new website, I have also worked on the existing legacy site, which can be found at 
                    <a href="https://www.vutc.com" target="_blank">vutc.com</a>. My projects have included creating an Events Dashboard, 
                    which displays 12 key pieces of information about each event, allowing for easier management of multiple events at once.
                    In addition, I created a system of client profiles to allow events management staff to better keep track of the needs 
                    of various clients, and a system to collect feedback from both clients and staff members. I have also made various 
                    other minor updates, including checking and updating protection against SQL injection on various forms.

                <p>
                    The Villanova School of Business considers hands-on and experiential learning to be invaluable in preparing students 
                    for working in the real world. One course that follows the model of experiential learning is Competitive Effectiveness, 
                    a 6-credit course combining the principles of management and marketing. Students, in groups of ten, work on marketing 
                    projects for clients by applying the concepts learned in class.

                    I worked on a project for AirWick, a brand of Reckitt Benckiser, which includes various air care products. The objective 
                    of the project is to increase the market share of AirWick in the liquid electricals category of the air care market. 
                    My role within the project was the Marketing Director, and I was responsible for ensuring the accuracy of marketing 
                    concepts as they are represented within the project, and that my group applies those same concepts to our work together.

                    <p>
                        I started playing ice hockey during my sophomore year of high school, in what would be classified as an 
                        impulsive decision. Although I do not generally advocate for impulsive decisions, this was a good one. 
                        In high school, my practices required waking up at 4:30am, which forced me to improve my time management 
                        and discipline.

                        When I have free time, I enjoy watching NHL hockey. I support the Detroit Red Wings, along with other 
                        Detroit sports teams, and some of my favorite players are Dylan Larkin and Niklas Kronwall, who has recently 
                        retired from play. I also enjoy attending games, including other local college teams.

                        When I first joined VUTC, it was as a job and a way to make friends. Since then, I have gotten genuinely 
                        interested in live sound and lighting. I enjoy reading about and looking at various sound and lighting 
                        setups, both online and while out. It is always interesting to enter a venue, and immediately start looking 
                        at the PA system.
