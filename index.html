            <p>I am currently a student at the Villanova School of Business, where I will graduate in 2022.

In addition, I am considering a second major or a minor in math, statistics, or computer science.</p>
            <p>Outside of classes, I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey and spending time with my team, as well as attending the events campus life has to offer. I dedicate a lot of my free time to Tech Crew, both as a job and a hobby. </p>

        <p>The hobby always bring up first when asked is ice hockeey. I have been playing for four seasons, and before that I figure skated for seven years. Since my hasty decision to begin playing, it has proved an outlet for my phsyical energy and a major learning experience. </p>

        <p>Since learning Python my freshman year of high school, I've had an interest in coding, which was furthered when I met computer science majors and joined Web Team through Tech Crew. In fact, this website was written as a hobby, with plenty of help from Google, Stack Overflow, and a hex color picker.</p>
