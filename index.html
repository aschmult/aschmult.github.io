            <h3>Villanova University</h3>
            <h4>Villanova, PA</h4>
            <p>I am currently a student at the Villanova School of Business, where I will graduate in 2022. Although I have yet to delare a major, I am particularly interested in finance, data analytics, and accounting. In addition, I am considering a second major or a minor in math, statistics, or computer science.</p>
            <p>I hope to be able to combine my passion for business with my love for math and computer science, such as working in applied data science or quantitative finance.</p>
            <p>Outside of classes, I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey and spending time with my team, as well as attending the events campus life has to offer. I dedicate a lot of my free time to Tech Crew, both as a job and a hobby.</p>

            <h3>Princeton High School</h3>
            <h4>Princeton, NJ</h4>
            <p>I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I ejoyed calculus and statistics.</p>
            <p>While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility.</p>

        <p>The hobby always bring up first when asked is ice hockeey. I have been playing for four seasons, and before that I figure skated for seven years. Since my hasty decision to begin playing, it has proved an outlet for my phsyical energy and a major learning experience. </p>
        <p>I was an active Girl Scout from 2006 to 2018, and currently hold a Lifetime Membership. The Girl Scouts gave me lifelong friends, </p>
        <p>Since learning Python my freshman year of high school, I've had an interest in coding, which was furthered when I met computer science majors and joined Web Team through Tech Crew. In fact, this website was written as a hobby, with plenty of help from Google, Stack Overflow, and a hex color picker.</p>
