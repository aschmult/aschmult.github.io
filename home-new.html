                    <p>I am currently a student at the Villanova School of Business, where I will graduate in 2022. I plan to declare majors in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics, and I have already declared a minor in Computer Science.</p>
                    <p>I hope to be able to combine my passion for business with my love for math and computer science, and I am particularly interested in working in database development and management.</p>
                    <p>Outside of classes, I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey and spending time with my team, as well as attending the events campus life has to offer. I dedicate a lot of my free time to Tech Crew, both as a job and a hobby.</p>

                    <p>I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I enjoyed calculus and statistics.</p>
                    <p>While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility.</p>

                    <h3>Villanova University Tech Crew</h3>
                    <p>Tech Crew is Villanova's student run event production business. We provide audio, lighting, and video support for events around campus, from guest speakers to large-scale concerts. In 2018, we had revenue of over $60,000, and worked 153 events.</p>
                    <p>I joined Tech Crew about a month after starting school at Villanova. During my first semester, I worked as an Event Staff and a Senior Staff member, and I took my Head Technician test in December. As a Head Technician, I am responsible for running client events. This includes managing a group of 3-8 staff, coordinating with clients, and troubleshooting technical issues. </p>
                    <p>At the start of 2019, I joined the Executive Board of Tech Crew as the Events Manager. As Events Manager, I take client specifications for events, and develop a plan for equipment and staffing. For large scale events, I attend production meetings and coordinate equipment rentals. Additionally, as problems with staffing or equipment arise, I work with other Executive Board members to find solutions.</p>

                    <p>During the summer of 2019, I worked at BetterTrader as a Research and Marketing Intern. When I started at BetterTrader, I noticed that blog content and articles needed improving on, both content-wise and gramatically. Additionally, social media was being underutilized.</p>
                    <p>At BetterTrader, I started three projects. First, I began a process of editing grammar and content of each blog post and article. Next, I edited each blog post and article to improve search engine optimization, by refining URLs, snippets, and SEO titles. Finally, I started posting short blog summaries three time a week on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>

                    <p>I started playing ice hockey during my sophomore of high school, in what would be classified as an impulsive decision. Although I do not generally advocate for impulsive decisions, this was a good one. In high school, my practices required waking up at 4:30am, which forced me to improve my time management and discipline.</p>
                    <p>Although I don't have abundant free time, I do enjoy watching NHL hockey. I support the Detroit Red Wings</p>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Between assignments for my classes and personal projects I choose to work on in my free time, I have worked on several things I am proud to have created. Here are a few:</p>
            <div class = "project"> <!--Project div indents each project and puts space between them-->
                <h3>My Professional Identity</h3>
                <p>This project was created for my Backpack to Briefcase professional development seminar during the middle of my first semester sophomore year. It provides a snapshot of the ideas and ambitions I had at the time, and I have chosen not to update it since.</p>

            </div>
            <div class = "project">
                <h3>My Website</h3>
                <p>This website was created as a personal project during the summer of 2019, while I was abroad interning at Better Trader. The website is written entirely from scratch, with help from w3schools and StackOverflow, and a lot of time working with a hex color picker and a css gradient maker. It is hosted through GitHub, and you can <span>view the repository,</span> which includes the current website, old versions, and some files that are me just playing around.</p>
                <p>The current site is the third version I have created. The <span>original version</span> of the site was fairly primitive and not written with best practices in mind, and was not at all mobile responsive. The <span>second version</span> was created to be somewhat similar to the current site, with a background and white cards, but was never quite finished. I intended to add functionality to have one card displayed on the first slide, but never got around to writing the JavaScript. In addition, using an image as the background slowed down the loading of the site.</p>
                <p>I created the current version of the site shortly after beginning to work on the Professional Identity project mentioned above. The original design for that project was plain white with grey lines dividing sections, but I decided to do something with some color, and I got the idea to do a gradient background with white cards, and I liked the style enough that I decided to re-do my website in the same style.</p>
