            <p>I'm Anna Schmult, a sophomore attending the Villanova School of Business, where I'm interested in the intersection of technology and business.</p>
            <p>Originally from Princeton, New Jersey, I chose to come to Villanova after hearing about the comprehensive education I could receive at VSB, and feeling the warm atmosphere around the entire Villanova campus.</p>
            <p>The first step to finding my future success is to define, for myself and for others, the ways in which I am already successful and the things that could keep me engaged for success in the fiture.</p>

            <p>When I arrived at Villanova, I wasn't exactly sure what field of business I was most interested in. As time went on, and I got involved in activities around campus and explored careers through my core business classes, I discovered that my interests lie at the intersection of business and technology.</p>
            <p>I'm planning to declare majors in Management Information Systems and Business Analytics, and I have already declared a minor in Computer Science. The courses for these programs have some overlapping content, so I'm excited to be able to apply what I learn in one course to what I am learnin in another.</p>
            <p>VSB has offered me a wider variety of resources to help me prepare for professional success, both through classes and the Clay Center. One of the most useful resources has been the VSB Majors Fair, which I attended early in the fall of my sophomore year. The Majors Fair gave me the opportunity to talk to professionals in various fields, and learn the wide variety of careers a given major could prepare me for. I was quite surpirsed at the applications of some degrees. For instance, I learned that the FBI hired accountants to investigate fraud, money laundering, and other financial crimes.</p>

            <p>Although I'm interested in the entire intersection of business and technology, one field that interests me in particular is database management. My experiences with extracurriculars have given me the chance to create and manage a database, and I have enjoyed the challenge of figuring out how to best collect, store, and retrieve data. </p>

        <h2>The Assignment:</h2>
        <p>
                1. Give your presentation a thoughtful title that reflects your professional identity<br>
                <br>2. Tell who you are in your own words<br>
                Introduce yourself as if you were doing so to a potential employer in a networking conversation. Elements to be addressed in this part of the presentation include your CliftonStrengths, skills, interests, and motivators -- your key “selling points.” Remember to provide real-life examples that demonstrate these things about you: only running down a list of these leaves out important parts of your story.<br>
                <br>3. Share your plans for your course of study at Villanova<br>
                This can include any major or minor options you are considering, and make sure to speak to how these will prepare you for your career after Villanova. Incorporate information and insights gained from class assignments/resources and guest speakers.<br>
                <br>4. Discuss the potential direction of your career<br>
                Focus the majority of your presentation on this section; incorporate how class assignments and conversations helped you determine your career interests, and be sure to do the following:<br>
                a. Define a specific area of interest within an industry (e.g. Marketing-sports marketing, advertising; Consulting- technology, strategy; Finance-investment banking, corporate finance, etc.) Consider and discuss 1-2 two potential courses, beyond those required for a given business major, which could help you develop knowledge in your area(s) of interest.<br>
                b. Explain how you plan to build a network of people who can support you on this path.<br>
                c. Talk about some specific companies for which you can envision yourself working and why.<br>
                d. Discuss how you fit with the industry/company culture. If you have similar interests, strengths, and goals, elaborate on those here.<br>
                <br>5. Talk about the important things you learned in this class<br>
                Focus on what decisions you made as a result of information you learned in class. For example, did you change or confirm your thoughts about your choice of major or longer-term career plans? Also, identify areas for growth in your career development. What parts of this class stretched you the most? How will you overcome challenges associated with developing your professional identity/brand and career ideas?</p>
