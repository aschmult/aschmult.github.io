                <h4>Villanova, PA</h4>
                <p>I am currently a student at the Villanova School of Business, where I will graduate in 2022. Although I have yet to delare a major, I am particularly interested in finance, data analytics, and accounting. In addition, I am considering a second major or a minor in math, statistics, or computer science.</p>
                <p>I hope to be able to combine my passion for business with my love for math and computer science, such as working in applied data science or quantitative finance.</p>
                <p>Outside of classes, I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey and spending time with my team, as well as attending the events campus life has to offer. I dedicate a lot of my free time to Tech Crew, both as a job and a hobby.</p>

                <h3>Princeton High School</h3>
                <h4>Princeton, NJ</h4>
                <p>I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I enjoyed calculus and statistics.</p>
                <p>While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility.</p>
