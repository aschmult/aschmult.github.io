            <h3>Villanova University</h3>
            <h4>Villanova, PA</h4>
            <p>I am currently a student at the Villanova School of Business, where I will graduate in 2022. Although I have yet to delare a major, I am particularly interested in finance, data analytics, and accounting. In addition, I am considering a second major or a minor in math, statistics, or computer science.</p>
            <p>I hope to be able to combine my passion for business with my love for math and computer science, such as working in applied data science or quantitative finance.</p>
            <p>Outside of classes, I enjoy playing and watching ice hockey and spending time with my team, as well as attending the events campus life has to offer. I dedicate a lot of my free time to Tech Crew, both as a job and a hobby.</p>

            <h3>Princeton High School</h3>
            <h4>Princeton, NJ</h4>
            <p>I attended Princeton High School from 2014-2018. During my time at PHS, I discovered my love for science, especially chemistry and physics. I also discovered that math could be fun, and I enjoyed calculus and statistics.</p>
            <p>While at PHS, I was active in the school's choirs, including a tour to Southern Spain in February of 2017. I also was a member of the PHS Girl's Ice Hockey Team for three seasons, which I deeply enjoyed. In both organizations, I took an active role fundraising and working to improve my leadership skills. I credit the PHS Hockey Program with teaching me time management and personal responsibility.</p>

            <h3>BetterTrader</h3>
            <p>During the summer of 2019, I worked at BetterTrader as a Research and Marketing Intern. When I started at BetterTrader, I noticed that blog content and articles needed improving on, both content-wise and gramatically. Additionally, social media was being underutilized.</p>
            <p>At BetterTrader, I started three projects. First, I began a process of editing grammar and content of each blog post and article. Next, I edited each blog post and article to improve search engine optimization, by refining URLs, snippets, and SEO titles. Finally, I started posting short blog summaries three time a week on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>
            <p>BetterTrader is located in the High Tech Village on the campus of Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Israel. I spent June and July in Israel, on a program called jInternship. jInternship is a program for Jewish students to work at internships in Israel, as well as attend classes relating to Judaism, including Hebrew lessons. </p>

            <h3>Villanova University Tech Crew</h3>
            <p>Tech Crew is Villanova's student run event production business. We provide audio, lighting, and video support for events around campus, from guest speakers to large-scale concerts. In 2018, we had reveune of over $60,000, and worked 153 events.</p>
            <p>I joined Tech Crew about a month after starting school at Villanova. During my first semester, I worked as an Event Staff and a Senior Staff member, and I took my Head Technician test in December. As a Head Technician, my responsibilities are to be responsibile for client events. This includes managing a group of 3-8 staff, coordinating with clients, and troubleshooting technical issues. </p>
            <p>At the start of 2019, I joined the Executive Board of Tech Crew as the Events Manager. As Events Manager, I take client specifications for events, and develop a plan for equipment and staffing. For large scale events, I attend production meetings and coordinate equipment rentals. Additionally, as problems with staffing or equipment arise, I work with other Executive Board members to find solutions.</p>

        <h2><a id="hobbies">My Hobbies</a></h2>
        <p>The hobby I most like talking about is ice hockey. I began playing quite suddenly in 2015, after seven years of figure skating. Since then, I have played four seasons of ice hockey. Playing hockey has given me wonderful friends and a great time-waster during Stanley Cup Playoffs season. I am a fan of the Detroit Red Wings, and my favorite players are Dylan Larkin and Niklas Kronwall. </p>
        <p>I was an active Girl Scout from 2006 to 2018, and currently hold a Lifetime Membership. I enjoyed camping with my troop, doing community service, and mentoring younger girls. The Girl Scouts gave me lifelong friends, and several wonderful summers at camp. I was a camper at Camp Mosey Wood from 2012-2015, and in 2016 I attended their CIT programs. In 2017 and 2018, I worked at Camp Laughing Waters, where I made lifelong friends and learned how to lead a small team of peers.</p>
        <p>Since learning Python my freshman year of high school, I've had an interest in coding, which was furthered when I met computer science majors and joined Web Team through Tech Crew. In fact, this website was written as a hobby, with plenty of help from Google, Stack Overflow, and a hex color picker. It is written mostly in HTML, with CSS styling.</p>
